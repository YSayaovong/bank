# Swiss Bank Simulation

This project is a simple bank simulation implemented in Python using object-oriented programming principles. The project demonstrates the use of abstract base classes, inheritance, method overriding, and basic account operations.

## Project Overview

This project includes two classes:
1. **Bank** - An abstract base class representing a generic bank.
2. **Swiss** - A derived class representing a specific bank (Swiss Bank) that inherits from the `Bank` class.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Abstract Base Classes**: The `Bank` class is an abstract base class (ABC) that defines a structure for derived classes.
- **Method Overriding**: The `Swiss` class overrides the `basicinfo()` and `withdraw()` methods of the abstract class.
- **Account Operations**: The `Swiss` class includes basic account functionalities such as checking account info and withdrawing funds with balance checks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
